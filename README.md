# Kinematic Puppet Toolkit

A modular, sensor-enabled prototyping toolkit for exploring human‚Äìrobot interaction (HRI) in surgical and collaborative settings. Developed to support low-cost, tangible, and situated prototyping without the need for complex programming or access to industrial robotic systems.

## üß© What‚Äôs Included

This repository contains:
- 3D-printable joint files and parametric arm link templates
- Arduino-based encoder hub PCB and firmware
- Step-by-step build guide with materials list
- Sample code for data capture and digital twin integration
- (Optional) Blender visualisation rig setup

## üéØ Key Features

- **Modular** ‚Äì Build a range of robot arm forms, including UR5/UR10 analogues
- **Sensor-enabled** ‚Äì Capture joint rotations via rotary encoders
- **Digital twin ready** ‚Äì Output movement data to simulation platforms
- **Low-cost & accessible** ‚Äì Made from off-the-shelf parts and 3D printed components
- **Supports roleplay / Wizard-of-Oz** ‚Äì Can be puppeteered in real time to simulate robotic behaviour

## üöÄ Getting Started

You‚Äôll need:
- Basic soldering tools
- Access to a 3D printer (FDM recommended)
- Arduino IDE + a compatible board (e.g., ESP32, Arduino Nano)
- Materials: PVC pipe (or equivalent), bolts, encoders (details in guide)

See the `build_guide/` folder for full instructions.

## üé• Example Use

This toolkit was developed and tested as part of a research-through-design study exploring embodied prototyping in robotic-assisted orthopaedic surgery. It has been used to:
- Reverse-engineer HRI workflows
- Test spatial and control concepts

## üë§ Who Is This For?

- HRI and HCI researchers
- Designers exploring human‚Äìrobot interaction
- Educators and students working on HRI research projects
